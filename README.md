# VulkanTutorial
Refactored code of the famous vulkan-tutorial

It requires to install separate libraries as it is state in the tutorial website
And the VS 2019 projects have the librarie's locations harcoded. So, please change these values befre attempting to compile

In addition I also included here the spinning cube example. Just to show of my adquired VK knowledge
